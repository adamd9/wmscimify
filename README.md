## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to take the existing <a href="https://developer.walkme.com/reference#user-management-api">WalkMe User Management API</a> and make it <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups'>a SCIM compliant endpoint</a> to the point where it can be practically used for automated user provisioning in Azure AD.

Functional gaps that prevent the WalkMe User Management API from being used for automated user provisioning:
 - Needs to support a permenant
 - Needs to support a GET filter query on userName

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Grab a copy of the code, make sure you have your WalkMe API credeentials handy, as well as an Azure tenant. The code is just based on Node.JS so it's probably not too hard to pull it out and run it as a standalone Node app with some modification.

### Prerequisites

 - Visual Studio Code with the following extensions:
   - Azure Account
   - Azure Functions
   - Azure Resources
 - A WalkMe MSA account with valid API credentials to the user management API
 - Azure tenant with admin access to manage:
   - Enterprise application registrations
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Azure Functions


### Installing

Download the code and configure your local Azure functions environment.

Verify that your WalkMe API credntials work to <a href='https://developer.walkme.com/reference#getting-started-with-your-api-1'>get you a beaer token</a>.

Note down the Base 64 version of your credentials.

Perform an initial publish of the code to a new Azure Function, note down the endpoint URL.

In Azure, enable your Function App for Identify management, so that it can be managed as an Azure AD resource.

In Azure, set up a new Key Vault with:
 - A secret called `functiontoken` with any random value (this will be used to secure your new SCIM endpoint)
 - A secret called `wmcredentials` with the WalkMe credentiasl as a the base64 encoding of the consumer key and consumer secrect of the WalkMe account joined by a colon.
 - An access policy that allows the GET and LIST functions for Secrets, with your Azure Function App as the service principal

Once created, note down the seccret identfier (URL) for each secret.

In Azure > Function App > Configuration, add your two secrets as application settings:
 - Name: `functiontoken` | Value: `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=<your secret identifier URL>`) 
 - Name: `wmcredentials` | Value: `@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=<your secret identifier URL>`) 

Restart your application

You should now be able to access your SCIM endpoint at  https://\<function app name\>.azurewebsites.net/api/scim/users/

Try a GET call with the value from your `functiontoken` as the Bearer token - you should get back your user list.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Supports the following calls:

GET /users (get all users)
GET /users/:user_id (i.e. d133726f-e23d-39e5-423c-0923ds29040)
GET /users?filter=userName+eq+"userName" (i.e. user@company.com)

POST /users (create user)
PATCH /users/:user_id (update user)
DELETE /users/:user_id (delete user)

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Once the app is working, you then need to register a new enterprise application (non gallery app). Call it something like "WalkMe Admin User Management". This can manage your user provisioning, as well as your SAML SSO integration for authenticting users.

Once completed, go to App Registrations > \<your app\> > App Roles and add as many user roles as you have in WalkMe. (including any custom ones). Note that the Display Name MUST match the WalkMe role name EXACTLY, as this how user roles are managed.

Next, go to Enterprise Applications > \<your app\> > Provisioning and set up automated provisioing, where your endpoint is your function app endpoint i.e. https://\<function app name\>.azurewebsites.net/api/scim (without the /users part). Your secret token is the secret from `functiontoken`.

You should get a green tick.

Once this is done, you can assign users to your app, and assign them a role and they will be provisioned in WalkMe!

Notes:
 - Supports First Name, Last Name, Principal User Name as mappings
 - Supports assigning the user a WalkMe Access Role as defined in App Registrations > App Roles
 - DOES NOT support assigning systems (yet)
 - DOES NOT support a soft-delete (which occurs when a user is removed from the Azure App, but not removed from Azure AD)
